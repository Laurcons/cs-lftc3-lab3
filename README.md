Symbol Table with a binary search tree backend.

Written in TypeScript (JavaScript) using the Bun runtime.

ST supports:

- `register`: Add an entry in the symbol table.
- `get`: Retrieve a value from the symbol table.
- `has`: Check whether a value exists in the symbol table.

The binary tree is not balanced. This is an optimization problem that is
left as an exercise for the reader\*.

\*Reader will be me in two weeks when I notice the run times are too long.
